- Makes the complex process of preparing a USB drive for Xbox 360 soft modding *simple* and *accessible* to everyone  
- Completely open source — intended for learning and customization, **not** for code theft or unauthorized redistribution  

## Key Features

  - Automatically formats the USB stick to FAT32 with the correct partition and file system settings required by the Xbox 360  
  - Includes progress updates and status messages to keep the user informed during the formatting process  

- **One-Click Setup:**  
  - Designed for ease of use — users simply click a button and BadStick does the rest, eliminating manual file copying or command line work  

- **BadUpdate Payload Installation:**  
  - Installs the official free trial version of *Rock Band Blitz* — a key component needed to trigger the BadUpdate exploit  
  - Automatically copies and configures the BadUpdate exploit payload files onto the USB drive  

- **Additional Homebrew Integration:**  
  - Installs XeXMenu 1.2, the popular homebrew dashboard and file manager for Xbox 360

- **Safe & Reversible Soft Mod:**  
  - Utilizes the BadUpdate exploit, a soft mod method that does **not** permanently modify the Xbox 360 firmware or hardware  
  - When the console is rebooted or powered off, the exploit must be run again — ensuring no permanent changes or risk to warranty (aside from violating TOS)  
  - Perfect for users who want to experiment with homebrew without the risks of hard modding  

## About the BadUpdate Exploit

  ## Other Information
  BadStick was made to be a free and open source tool, not only to make it easier for people to get BadUpdate running on
  their consoles, but also for people to learn. With that being said, nobody has my permission to reupload this or to
  integrate this in other programs without my explicit permission. I am all for people learning off of me, but not people
  stealing my work to re-release as theirs. Simply ask, and I will allow! :)
